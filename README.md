# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset and builds a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict survival.
## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (Family Size, Title extraction)
- Model training with Random Forest
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
- Visualizations: confusion heatmap & feature importance

-## ðŸ”§ Tools & Environment
- Python (via **Anaconda** distribution)
- Conda virtual environment for dependency management
- VS Code with Jupyter (`.ipynb`) extension
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- Folder Structure
